CMSC 421-02 (Fall 2017) Project 2
Author: Stephanie Tam (ru14618@umbc.edu)


Approach:
For the project, I followed the project description and the approach. The implementation of Phase 1 was relatively easy since it was just figuring out the algorithm to calculate the level and offset.

As for Phases 2 and 3, I mostly understood the concepts of splitting and coalescing. For some reason, I couldn't fix the errors that I was getting when I ran my own tests. Some of the errors were: incorrectly marking the bitmap as used, ZONES nr >= nzones, buffer I/O error upon unmounting, to name a few. I tried my best to fix the errors; however, I couldn't, even though my logic would align with that of others who had theirs working correctly. Because of such, I essentially surrendered and accepted that I most likely couldn't get it completely working.
